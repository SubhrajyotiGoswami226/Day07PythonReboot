Day 07: Hangman Game

Welcome to **Day 07** of my **100 Days of Python Challenge**! 🎮  
This repository contains a **Hangman Game** project, where you try to guess a word letter by letter before running out of lives.

📝 Project Description

The **Hangman Game** lets players:
1. Guess a randomly selected word.
2. Keep track of incorrect guesses and display a corresponding hangman image.
3. Have 6 lives to guess the word correctly, or they lose the game.

🛠️ Key Features:
- Uses Python's 'random' library to pick a random word.
- Displays a visual representation of the hangman with each wrong guess.
- Keeps track of correct and incorrect guesses.
- Ends the game when the player guesses the word or runs out of lives.

🎯 Purpose
This project is designed to:

Enhance knowledge of conditional statements, loops, and lists in Python.
Practice user input validation and handling.
Build a fun and interactive game to solidify core Python concepts.

🌟 Acknowledgments
Inspired by the 100 Days of Python Challenge, this project demonstrates how to create interactive games and further develop problem-solving skills in Python.
